# JuliaLSODA

## Work In Progress

This repository is a preparation for the [JVODE](https://github.com/YingboMa/JVODE.jl) job. It will be based on the [original fortran version](http://faculty.washington.edu/tlarson/SCICHEM3.0b2/src/lib/util/odepack/lsoda.f)  and the [C version](https://github.com/sdwfrost/liblsoda).
